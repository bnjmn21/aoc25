# Advent of code 2025

My solutions for this year's advent of code.

Run a particular solution with:

```sh
cargo run -F <puzzle name, e.g. 1a>
```

The inputs for each puzzle must be provided in the inputs directory (download yourself, it is gitignored).
The input for day 8 would be put at `inputs/8.txt` for example.
Note that input files cannot end with a trailing newline, that will throw off some of the algorithms.
